TTP_Repository
==============

Repository for ONF TTP Development

This GitHub repository is intended to hold material to help SDN developers develop (and learn how to develop)
Table Type Patterns (TTPs) as specified in the [ONF Technical Specification](https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/OpenFlow%20Table%20Type%20Patterns%20v1.0.pdf)

A [FAQ concerning TTPs](https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TTP_Repository/blob/master/TTP-FAQ.md) can be found in this repository.

The repository also includes directories containing example TTPs (some pedagogical and some practical) and associated
descriptions.

The repository also includes ideas about useful TTP development tools (and we hope someday also the tools themselves).

Feel free to browse, learn and contribute.

Send any comments to the ONF (Open Networking Foundation) Open Datapath Working Group (opendatapath@lists.opennetworking.org).
